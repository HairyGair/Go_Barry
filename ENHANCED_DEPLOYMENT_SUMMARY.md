## 🚀 To Deploy Your Enhanced Display Screen:

### Option 1: Run the Deployment Script (Recommended)
```bash
chmod +x deploy-enhanced-cpanel.sh
./deploy-enhanced-cpanel.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the React Native Web app with Expo
2. Copy all enhanced components (including your new DisplayScreen)
3. Create optimized bundle for production
4. Generate `go-barry-enhanced-cpanel.zip` for upload

### Option 2: Manual Build
```bash
cd Go_BARRY
npx expo export --platform web --output-dir ../cpanel-deployment-enhanced --clear
cd ..
zip -r go-barry-enhanced-cpanel.zip cpanel-deployment-enhanced/
```
