## 🌐 How It Works After Upload

### Homepage (https://gobarry.co.uk)

- **Live system status** indicator showing API connectivity
- **Fully responsive** design for all devices

### Control Room Display (https://gobarry.co.uk/display-screen/)
- **24/7 traffic monitoring** designed for large screens
- **Real-time alerts** from Go Barry API (https://go-barry.onrender.com)
- **Priority system**: Critical (blinking), Urgent, Monitor

## 🔌 Live API Integration

All interfaces connect to your live backend:
- **API**: https://go-barry.onrender.com
- **Real-time data** from TomTom, HERE, National Highways
- **GTFS route matching** for Go North East services
- **Enhanced locations** with actual street names
- **Automatic failover** if APIs are temporarily unavailable

## 📦 What You Need to Do

Upload everything in the `deployment-package/` folder to your web hosting, maintaining the folder structure:
