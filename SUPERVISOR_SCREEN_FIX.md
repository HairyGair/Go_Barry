# üö¶ Supervisor Screen Incident Manager - FIXED

## Issue Identified ‚úÖ

The Supervisor Screen's Incident Manager wasn't working because:

1. **Missing API Connection**: The backend had an `incidentAPI.js` file but it wasn't connected to the main server
2. **Missing Endpoints**: Several endpoints that the IncidentManager component needed were missing:
   - `/api/geocode/:location` - For location search
   - `/api/routes/search-stops` - For GTFS stop search  
   - `/api/routes/find-near-coordinate` - For finding affected routes

## What Was Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Connected Incident API to Backend
```javascript
// Added to backend/index.js:
import incidentAPI from './routes/incidentAPI.js';
app.use('/api/incidents', incidentAPI);
```

### 2. Added Missing Geocoding Endpoint
```javascript
// Added to backend/index.js:
app.get('/api/geocode/:location', async (req, res) => {
  // Uses existing geocoding.js service
  const result = await geocodeLocation(location);
  // Returns coordinates for incident locations
});
```

### 3. Added GTFS Stop Search Endpoint
```javascript
// Added to backend/index.js:
app.get('/api/routes/search-stops', async (req, res) => {
  // Searches for bus stops by name/code
  // Returns sample North East stops for now
});
```

### 4. Added Route Finder Endpoint
```javascript
// Added to backend/index.js:
app.get('/api/routes/find-near-coordinate', async (req, res) => {
  // Uses existing findRoutesNearCoordinatesFixed function
  // Returns affected bus routes for incident locations
});
```

## How to Test üß™

### Step 1: Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Run the Test Script
```bash
cd "Go BARRY App"
node test-incident-api.js
```

This will test all the endpoints the IncidentManager needs.

### Step 3: Test in Browser
1. Open the browser interface
2. Login as a supervisor
3. Navigate to "Incident Manager" in the sidebar
4. Try creating a new incident
5. Search for locations (should now show suggestions)
6. The incident should be created with affected routes

## What Should Work Now ‚úÖ

1. **‚úÖ Incident List**: Shows all active incidents
2. **‚úÖ Create New Incident**: Modal opens with form
3. **‚úÖ Location Search**: Auto-complete with geocoding  
4. **‚úÖ Stop Search**: GTFS bus stop suggestions
5. **‚úÖ Route Detection**: Automatically finds affected routes
6. **‚úÖ Incident Types**: Roadworks, Traffic Incident, Planned Event, Infrastructure
7. **‚úÖ Supervisor Authentication**: Links to supervisor session

## API Endpoints Now Available

- `GET /api/incidents` - List all incidents
- `POST /api/incidents` - Create new incident  
- `PUT /api/incidents/:id` - Update incident
- `DELETE /api/incidents/:id` - Delete incident
- `GET /api/geocode/:location` - Geocode location
- `GET /api/routes/search-stops?query=...` - Search stops
- `GET /api/routes/find-near-coordinate?lat=...&lng=...` - Find routes

## Backend Console Output

When working, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Connected incident management routes
üó∫Ô∏è Backend geocoding location: "Newcastle"  
üéØ Enhanced GTFS Match: Found 5 routes near...
```

## Frontend Expected Behavior

The IncidentManager should now:
- Load without errors
- Show "No Active Incidents" initially
- Allow creating incidents via "New Incident" button
- Provide location autocomplete
- Auto-detect affected bus routes
- Display GTFS statistics

## Next Steps

If the basic functionality works, we can enhance:
1. Real GTFS stop data instead of samples
2. Enhanced route matching with confidence scores
3. Integration with live traffic alerts
4. Incident-to-alert correlation
5. Advanced supervisor notifications

## Troubleshooting

If it still doesn't work:
1. Check backend console for import errors
2. Verify all endpoints return 200 status
3. Check browser console for fetch errors
4. Ensure supervisor is logged in
5. Test individual endpoints with the test script
