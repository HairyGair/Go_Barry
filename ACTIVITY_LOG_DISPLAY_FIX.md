# Activity Log Display Issues - Diagnosis & Fix

## Issues Found

### 1. **Details Column Format**
The `details` column in `activity_logs` table might be TEXT instead of JSONB, causing parsing issues.

**Fix**: Added JSON parsing in DisplayScreen.jsx to handle string details:
```javascript
let parsedDetails = details;
if (typeof details === 'string') {
  try {
    parsedDetails = JSON.parse(details);
  } catch (e) {
    parsedDetails = {};
  }
}
```

### 2. **ScreenType Filter**
The DisplayScreen was filtering by `screenType=supervisor` which might exclude some activities.

**Fix**: Removed the filter to show all activities:
```javascript
// Before: 
fetch('.../api/activity/logs?limit=10&screenType=supervisor')
// After:
fetch('.../api/activity/logs?limit=10')
```

### 3. **Duty Numbers Updated**
Updated to match your specification:
- Duty 100: 05:15-14:45 (Mon-Fri), 06:00-15:30 (Sat-Sun)
- Duty 200: 07:30-17:00
- Duty 400: 12:30-22:00
- Duty 500: 14:45-00:15
- XOps: Variable (Ops Support)

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
Added detailed console logs to track data flow:
- Shows when fetching activities
- Logs response status
- Shows received data structure
- Logs formatted activities count

## Testing Steps

1. **Check table structure**:
```bash
chmod +x check-activity-logs-table.sh
./check-activity-logs-table.sh
# Run the generated SQL in Supabase to check/fix table structure
```

2. **Test activity creation**:
```bash
chmod +x test-direct-activity.sh
./test-direct-activity.sh
```

3. **Debug endpoints**:
```bash
chmod +x debug-activity-logs.sh
./debug-activity-logs.sh
```

## What to Check

1. Open browser console on Display Screen
2. Look for these logs:
   - "üîÑ Fetching activity logs..."
   - "üìä Activity data received:"
   - "‚úÖ Formatted activities: X"

3. If you see "‚ö†Ô∏è No logs in response", the API isn't returning data
4. If you see activities but they're not displaying, check the console for parsing errors

## SQL Fix (if needed)

If the details column is TEXT, run this in Supabase:
```sql
ALTER TABLE activity_logs 
ALTER COLUMN details TYPE jsonb 
USING details::jsonb;
```

## Summary
The issue is likely that activities are being logged correctly but either:
1. The details field is being stored as a string instead of JSON
2. The screenType filter was excluding activities
3. The frontend wasn't parsing the string details properly

All three issues have been addressed in the code changes.
