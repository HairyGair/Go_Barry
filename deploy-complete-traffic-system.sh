# Commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "🚦 COMPLETE TRAFFIC INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM

✅ Multi-Source Traffic Integration:
- TomTom: Primary source with enhanced street names
- HERE: Secondary source with comprehensive coverage  
- MapQuest: Additional regional coverage
- National Highways: Major road closures and works

✅ Enhanced GTFS Route Matching:
- Real bus route coordinate matching (250m radius)
- Geographic fallback for comprehensive coverage
- Accurate route detection using actual GTFS data

✅ Auto-Cancellation System:
- 4-hour auto-cleanup for traffic incidents
- 2-hour cleanup for low-severity alerts
- End-time based cancellation
- Status-based resolution detection

✅ Supervisor Accountability:
- Manual dismiss with required reason
- Full audit trail with supervisor details
- Session validation and IP tracking
- Dismissal history for accountability

✅ Intelligent Processing:
- Smart duplicate removal across sources
- Source preference ranking (TomTom > HERE > MapQuest > National Highways)
- Enhanced location processing with street names
- Memory optimization for Render deployment

Backend: Enhanced /api/alerts-enhanced endpoint
Frontend: Ready for all traffic sources
Display: Auto-updating with resolved incident cleanup"
