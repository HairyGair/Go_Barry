echo "📋 FINAL STEP NEEDED:"
echo "======================================"
echo "Go to Render Dashboard and set:"
echo ""
echo "   Variable: NATIONAL_HIGHWAYS_API_KEY"
echo "   Value: d2266b385f64d968f330969398b2961"
echo ""
echo "🔗 URL: https://dashboard.render.com"
echo "    → Your service → Environment tab"
echo "    → Add Environment Variable"
echo ""
echo "⏱️ After setting the API key:"
echo "   1. Wait 2-3 minutes for redeploy"
echo "   2. Test: node detailed-source-test.js"
echo ""
echo "🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "   ✅ TomTom: 15 alerts"
echo "   ✅ MapQuest: 15 alerts"
echo "   ✅ National Highways: 5-10 alerts"  
echo "   📊 Total: 3/3 sources = 100% enabled sources working"
echo "   ⚡ Faster response times (no HERE timeout)"
echo ""
echo "🎉 Benefits of 3-source system:"
echo "   - 35-40 total alerts (excellent coverage)"
echo "   - Sub-5 second response times"
echo "   - 100% reliability on enabled sources"
echo "   - Covers TomTom + MapQuest + major highways"
echo "   - Can re-enable HERE later if API format is fixed"
