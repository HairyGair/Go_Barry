git commit -m "🔧 Fix supervisor screen filtering bug

CRITICAL FIX: Supervisor dashboard was filtering out real traffic alerts

Changes:
- Fixed overly aggressive filtering that removed enhanced alerts
- Only filter obvious test data (test_data, sample_test, demo_)
- Keep all real traffic alerts from tomtom/here/mapquest sources  
- Added 'Recent Traffic Alerts' section to show all incidents
- Enhanced logging to track what alerts are being displayed
- Added route information display with enhanced badges

The Issue:
- Line 72: alert.enhanced === true was filtering out REAL alerts
- Our fixed backend sends enhanced properties on legitimate incidents
- Supervisor screen showed 0 alerts while display screen worked

The Fix:
- Only filter obvious test patterns, not enhanced real data
- Added source-based filtering (keep tomtom/here/mapquest)
- Show all traffic alerts in new dedicated section
- Better debugging logs to track filtering

Result: 
- Alerts now appear on supervisor screens with route info
- Display screen continues working as before  
- Enhanced data properly shown to supervisors"
