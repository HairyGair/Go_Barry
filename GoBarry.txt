üí° Enhanced Development Notes
Working with Claude on Go BARRY Intelligence Platform
When asking Claude to help with Go BARRY development, provide this context:
"We're working on Go BARRY, a comprehensive AI-powered traffic intelligence platform for Go North East bus operations. The system features a Node.js backend with Express serving enhanced traffic data from multiple APIs (TomTom, MapQuest, HERE, National Highways), enhanced with machine learning severity prediction, route impact analysis, and predictive analytics. The enhanced GTFS matching system uses 2GB memory optimization for 80-90% route identification accuracy with spatial indexing and shape analysis. The frontend is React Native with Expo, supporting four interfaces: browser (supervisor workstation with analytics dashboard), mobile (field use with message templates), display screen (24/7 control room monitoring with ML prioritization), and analytics dashboard (AI insights and recommendations). The system is deployed on Render.com with 2GB memory optimization and includes intelligent features like automated messaging templates, predictive hotspot analysis, route vulnerability assessment, and continuous ML learning capabilities."
