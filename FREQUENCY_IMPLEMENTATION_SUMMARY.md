# Service Frequency & Information System - Implementation Summary

## üöÄ What We've Implemented

### 1. **Service Frequency Analysis System**
- **Backend Service**: `serviceFrequencyAnalyzer.js`
  - Analyzes GTFS data to calculate route frequencies
  - Categorizes services: high-frequency (‚â§10 min), frequent, moderate, hourly, infrequent
  - Provides peak/midday/evening frequency breakdowns
  - Calculates passenger impact scores

### 2. **New API Endpoints**
```
GET  /api/frequency/route/:routeId     - Single route frequency
POST /api/frequency/routes             - Multiple routes with impact
GET  /api/frequency/high-frequency     - List high-frequency routes
POST /api/frequency/refresh            - Force data refresh
```

### 3. **Service Information Dashboard** (New Tab)
- **Location**: Services tab in mobile app
- **Features**:
  - Real-time service frequency for all routes
  - Expected bus positions based on schedule
  - Service hours and trip counts
  - Category filtering (high-frequency, frequent, etc.)
  - Quick actions for tracking and incidents

### 4. **Enhanced Alert System**
- Alerts now include frequency data
- High-frequency routes highlighted in yellow
- Service impact indicators (SEVERE/MAJOR/MODERATE)
- Frequency shown in route badges: "21 (every 10 min)"

### 5. **Supervisor Control Enhancements**
- Frequency impact summary bar
- Shows count of high-frequency disruptions
- Enhanced route badges with frequency info

## üîß To Deploy

1. **Run deployment script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy-frequency-service.sh
   ./deploy-frequency-service.sh
   ```

2. **Test the system**:
   ```bash
   node test-frequency-service.js
   node test-display-routes.js
   ```

## üêõ Display Screen Route Issue

The Display Screen showing wrong routes is likely because:
1. The frequency analyzer needs to be initialized before processing alerts
2. Some coordinates might not be matching routes correctly

**Fix**: Ensure the backend initializes the frequency analyzer on startup:
```javascript
// In index.js initialization
await serviceFrequencyAnalyzer.initialize();
```

## üìä Benefits for Control Room

1. **Instant Prioritization**: See which disruptions affect busiest routes
2. **Better Resource Allocation**: Focus on high-frequency corridor issues  
3. **Passenger Impact Awareness**: "500 passengers affected" vs just "Route 21"
4. **Service Overview**: Complete view of all route frequencies and schedules
5. **Expected Positions**: Know where buses should be based on timetables

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Deploy frequency service to production
2. Verify Display Screen shows correct routes with frequency
3. Train supervisors on new Service Information tab
4. Monitor usage and gather feedback
5. Consider adding real-time vehicle tracking integration
