- APIs: /api/alerts-enhanced (primary), /api/supervisor/*, /api/intelligence/*, etc.
- Data: GTFS integration, ML predictions, supervisor accountability, real-time processing

CURRENT CHALLENGES:
- Alert deduplication (recently improved with hash-based system)
- Memory optimization for 2GB Render limit
- MapQuest API authentication issues
- Elgin/SCOOT integration in progress

DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:
- Maintain system stability and performance
- Enhance ML prediction accuracy
- Complete remaining API integrations
- Improve supervisor user experience

When helping:
1. Consider production constraints (2GB memory, Render deployment)
2. Maintain compatibility with existing supervisor workflows
3. Preserve audit trails and accountability features
4. Test changes with existing testing framework
5. Follow the established component and service architecture
"""
