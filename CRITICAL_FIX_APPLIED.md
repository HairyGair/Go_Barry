# ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - TimeBasedPollingManager

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'now' before initialization`
**Location**: `/backend/services/timeBasedPollingManager.js` line 109
**Impact**: Critical failure in enhanced alerts endpoint

## Root Cause
Variable `now` was being used in the TomTom scheduling logic before it was declared later in the function.

## Solution Applied
1. Moved `const now = Date.now();` to the top of the `canPollSource()` function
2. Removed duplicate declaration that appeared later in the function
3. This ensures `now` is available for all logic that needs it

## Files Modified
- `backend/services/timeBasedPollingManager.js` - Fixed variable initialization order

## Testing
- Created `test-polling-manager-fix.js` to verify the fix works
- The enhanced alerts endpoint should now function correctly

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The Go BARRY system should now operate without this critical error.
