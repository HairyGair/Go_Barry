git commit -m "🚨 EMERGENCY FIX: Complete memory optimization for Render

❌ ISSUE: Backend still crashing with heap overflow on Render
✅ FIX: 
- Override npm start to use memory-optimized version directly
- Complete index-optimized.js with all original functionality  
- Skip route visualization that causes memory crash
- Add proper memory monitoring and cleanup
- Conservative memory limits for free tier (150MB cleanup trigger)

🎯 This should immediately fix the crash on Render deployment"
