# Supervisor Display Screen Sync Fix

## Problem Summary
1. Backend is tracking sessions in memory but `getActiveSupervisors()` returns empty array
2. Activity logs are being created but not showing on Display Screen
3. Display Screen shows "0 SUPERVISORS" even when supervisors are logged in

## Root Cause
The `getActiveSupervisors()` function prioritizes memory cache but the memory check is failing due to timing issues. The sessions are created but the Display Screen polls before they're properly stored.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Session Storage Timing
Updated `supervisorManager.js` to ensure sessions are properly stored BEFORE returning from login.

### 2. Added Debug Endpoint
Created `/api/supervisor/debug-sessions` to verify what's in memory.

### 3. Fixed Activity Logs Query
Ensured `/api/activity/logs` returns data in the correct format expected by Display Screen.

## Quick Test Steps
1. Login as any supervisor
2. Check console for "Active supervisors after login: 1"
3. Visit https://go-barry.onrender.com/api/supervisor/debug-sessions
4. Should show the active session
5. Display Screen should now show "1 SUPERVISORS"

## Files Modified
- backend/services/supervisorManager.js - Fixed session tracking
- backend/routes/supervisorAPI.js - Added debug endpoint
