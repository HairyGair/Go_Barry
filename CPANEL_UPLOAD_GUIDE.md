## 📁 **Step-by-Step cPanel Upload Instructions**

### **Step 1: Login to cPanel**
1. **Go to**: `https://pixelish.co.uk/cpanel` (or your hosting control panel)
2. **Login** with your hosting credentials
3. **Find and click**: "File Manager" (usually in the Files section)

### **Step 2: Navigate to Website Root**
1. **Open**: `public_html` folder (this is your website root)
2. **Look for**: Your current website files (you should see index.html or similar)
3. **This is where** your current "BARRY Traffic Intelligence" site lives

### **Step 3: Upload Go Barry Display Files**
1. **Click**: "Upload" button in File Manager
2. **Upload these 2 files** from your Mac:
   - `/Users/anthony/Go BARRY App/display.html`
   - `/Users/anthony/Go BARRY App/gobarry-logo.png`
3. **Make sure** both files are in the `public_html` directory (same level as your current site files)

### **Step 4: Test Your Display**
**Open in browser**: `https://gobarry.co.uk/display.html`

## 🎯 **Detailed File Manager Steps**

### **Finding the Files on Your Mac:**
1. **Open Finder**
2. **Navigate to**: `/Users/anthony/Go BARRY App/`
3. **You should see**:
   - `display.html` (the control room display)
   - `gobarry-logo.png` (your logo file)

### **In cPanel File Manager:**
```
public_html/
├── index.html (your current site)
├── display.html (← upload this)
├── gobarry-logo.png (← upload this)
└── (other existing files)
```

### **After Upload:**
- Your main site: `https://gobarry.co.uk` (unchanged)
- **New display**: `https://gobarry.co.uk/display.html` ✨

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Tips**

### **If Upload Fails:**
- **Check file size**: Logo should be under 10MB
- **Check file permissions**: Set to 644 if needed
- **Try one file at a time** if both fail

### **If Display Shows Errors:**
- **Check browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
- **Verify backend connection** to `https://go-barry.onrender.com`
- **Check logo path** (both files must be in same directory)

### **If Logo Doesn't Show:**
- **Fallback will display**: Professional "GO BARRY" text
- **Check spelling**: Ensure file is named exactly `gobarry-logo.png`
- **Check location**: Logo must be in same folder as display.html
