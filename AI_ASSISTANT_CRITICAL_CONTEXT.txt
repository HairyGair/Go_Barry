# GO BARRY - CRITICAL PROJECT CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANTS
# READ THIS FIRST IN EVERY NEW CHAT SESSION

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS - DON'T FORGET THESE!

1. **MEMORY LIMIT**: Backend runs on Render.com with 2GB RAM limit - ALWAYS optimize for memory
2. **NO localStorage/sessionStorage**: These don't work in Expo/React Native web - use React state only
3. **CORS IS FIXED**: Don't try to "fix" CORS - it's already properly configured for gobarry.co.uk
4. **DEDUPLICATION WORKS**: Alert deduplication is implemented and working - don't reimplement
5. **IMPORT STYLES**: Use ES6 imports (import X from 'Y') not CommonJS (require)
6. **SUPERVISOR SYSTEM**: 9 real supervisors with badge auth - don't create mock supervisors
7. **WEBSOCKET WORKS**: Supervisor sync via WebSocket is implemented at /ws/supervisor-sync
