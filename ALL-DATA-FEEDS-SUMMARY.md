## 📺 Display Screen Data Flow

### **Enhanced Endpoint Processing:**
1. **Intelligence Manager First** - Try ML-enhanced aggregation
2. **Direct Source Fallback** - If intelligence fails, fetch directly
3. **10-Second Refresh** - Near real-time updates (improved from 30s)
4. **Auto-Cycling** - 20-second rotation through alerts with map zoom

### **Enhanced Display Features:**
- ✅ ML confidence bars for prediction accuracy
- ✅ Passenger impact estimates from route analysis
- ✅ AI recommendations for each alert
- ✅ Data source health indicators
- ✅ Real-time ML accuracy metrics in header
- ✅ Enhanced alert cards with deep information

### **Alert Information Depth:**
```javascript
{
  // Basic Alert Data
  title: "Traffic incident description",
  location: "Enhanced with street names",
  coordinates: [lat, lng],
  severity: "ML-predicted severity",
  
  // ML Intelligence Enhancement
  intelligence: {
    confidence: 0.85,              // ML prediction confidence
    passengerImpact: {             // Route impact analysis
      estimated: "250 passengers",
      routes: ["21", "X21", "25"]
    },
    recommendation: "AI suggestion for handling",
    routeImpact: {
      impactLevel: "CRITICAL",
      totalImpactScore: 0.75
    }
  },
  
  // Enhanced Data
  affectsRoutes: ["21", "X21", "25"],  // GTFS-matched routes
  routeMatchMethod: "Enhanced GTFS",    // Matching accuracy
  confidenceScore: 0.85,               // Overall confidence
  enhanced: true                       // ML-processed flag
}
```

## 🔧 System Integration Points

### **Backend Integration:**
```javascript
// Enhanced Data Source Manager
import enhancedDataSourceManager from './services/enhancedDataSourceManager.js';

// Intelligence APIs
import intelligenceAPI from './routes/intelligenceAPI.js';
app.use('/api/intelligence', intelligenceAPI);

// Main enhanced endpoint
app.get('/api/alerts-enhanced', async (req, res) => {
  // 1. Try Enhanced Intelligence Manager
  const enhancedData = await enhancedDataSourceManager.aggregateAllSources();
  
  // 2. Fallback to direct source fetching if needed
  // 3. Apply ML enhancement and filtering
  // 4. Return comprehensive alert data
});
```

### **Frontend Integration:**
```javascript
// Supervisor Dashboard
const enhancedAlerts = await fetch('/api/alerts-enhanced');
// Gets all sources + ML intelligence

// Display Screen  
const displayAlerts = await fetch('/api/alerts-enhanced');
// Same enhanced endpoint, optimized refresh rate

// Intelligence Features
const insights = await fetch('/api/intelligence/analytics/insights');
const hotspots = await fetch('/api/intelligence/analytics/hotspots');
```
