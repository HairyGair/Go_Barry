# üîç DEBUG TEST

Upload this to cPanel and test:

1. Visit https://gobarry.co.uk/display
2. Look for RED BANNER at top that says "‚úÖ FIXED DISPLAY LOADED - 50/50 LAYOUT"

## If you see the RED BANNER:
- The correct React component is loading!
- The 50/50 layout should be working
- Problem was browser cache

## If you DON'T see the RED BANNER:
- The routing is broken
- Static HTML is overriding the React component
- We need to fix the routing system

## What to look for:
- Red banner = SUCCESS (component loading)
- No red banner = ROUTING PROBLEM
