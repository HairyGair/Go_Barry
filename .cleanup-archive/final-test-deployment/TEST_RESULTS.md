# 🔍 TEST RESULTS

Visit https://gobarry.co.uk/display and look for:

## 🔴 RED BANNER (top-left):
"✅ FIXED DISPLAY LOADED - 50/50 LAYOUT"
= app/display.jsx is being used

## 🟢 GREEN BANNER (top-right):
"🔧 COMPONENTS/DisplayScreen.jsx LOADED"  
= components/DisplayScreen.jsx is being used

## Expected Results:
- ONE banner should appear (not both)
- 50/50 layout: Alerts left, Map right
- Header shows: "X Supervisors Online"

## If NO banners appear:
- Routing is broken
- Neither React file is loading
- Static HTML is overriding everything
