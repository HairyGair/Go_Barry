# WebSocket Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## The Issue
You're seeing "Display Sync Offline (Testing Mode)" - this is **hardcoded text**, not an actual status check!

## Quick Fix
```bash
bash fix-websocket-status.sh
```
This will make the sidebar show the **real** WebSocket connection status.

## While Waiting for Deploy (3-5 mins)

### Use Built-in Testing Tools
Your app already has WebSocket testing tools! In the sidebar, try:

1. **WebSocket Test** (Ctrl+O or click in sidebar)
   - Shows raw WebSocket connection testing
   - Can test authentication directly

2. **WebSocket Diagnostics** (Ctrl+P or click in sidebar) 
   - Advanced diagnostics for connection issues
   - Shows detailed logs and connection states

3. **Integration Test** (Ctrl+2)
   - Tests supervisor ‚Üî display real-time sync
   - Good for verifying the full flow

### Check Browser Console
Press F12 and look for:
- `üîê Authentication attempt:` messages
- `üîå WebSocket connection` logs
- Any red error messages

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"User-Agent" CORS Error**
   - Run: `bash deploy-cors-fix.sh`
   - Wait 5 mins for rebuild

2. **Always Shows "Alex Woodcock"**
   - Run: `bash fix-supervisor-auth.sh`
   - Clear browser cache/cookies
   - Login again

3. **WebSocket Won't Connect**
   - Check if backend is running: https://go-barry.onrender.com/api/health
   - Try incognito/private browsing
   - Check firewall/network restrictions

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### In Sidebar:
- ‚úÖ Green dot + "Display Sync Active (1 display)" when connected
- üü° Yellow dot + "Connecting to display sync..." when connecting  
- üî¥ Red dot + "Display sync offline" when disconnected

### In Header:
- Small status indicator showing "Connected" or "Offline"

### On Display Screen:
- Should show your name (Anthony Gair) in the supervisors list
- Should update when you perform actions

## Debug Steps

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Login to supervisor screen
3. Click "Supervisor Control" 
4. Watch console for:
   ```
   üöÄ SupervisorControl WebSocket Auth: {
     supervisorId: "supervisor003",
     supervisorName: "Anthony Gair",
     sessionId: "session_xxx",
     ...
   }
   ```

5. If you see "NO_ID" or "NO_SESSION", the login didn't work properly

## Still Not Working?

1. Open `test-supervisor-auth.html` in your browser
2. Test authentication directly
3. Test WebSocket connection
4. Share the logs

The main issue is that the status display was fake - it wasn't actually checking anything! Once the fixes are deployed, you'll see the real connection status.
