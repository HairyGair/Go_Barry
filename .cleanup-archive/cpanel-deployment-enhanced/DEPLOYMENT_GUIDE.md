**❌ Activity feed empty:**
- Login to supervisor interface first
- Perform some actions (acknowledge alerts, add notes)
- Check if actions appear in feed within 2-3 seconds

**❌ Layout looks wrong:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check if CSS loaded properly
- Verify static assets uploaded correctly

### Integration Issues:
**❌ Supervisor actions don't sync:**
- Check CORS headers in browser console
- Verify .htaccess uploaded correctly
- Test API endpoints manually

**❌ Real-time updates not working:**
- Check if backend is running: https://go-barry.onrender.com/api/health
