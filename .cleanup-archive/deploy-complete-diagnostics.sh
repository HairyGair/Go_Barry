   - Full automated test sequence
   - Backend health check
   - Session creation test
   - Display connection test
   - Supervisor connection test
   - Real-time message logging

2. Enhanced Debug Logging:
   - Display screen logs all received WebSocket messages
   - Supervisor control logs all WebSocket messages
   - Display screen logs active supervisor data
   - All connection state changes logged

3. Visual Diagnostics:
   - Color-coded log messages
   - Session info display
