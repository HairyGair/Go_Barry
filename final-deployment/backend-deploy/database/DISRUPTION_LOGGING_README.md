# BARRY Disruption Logging System

## Overview
I've added a comprehensive disruption logging function to your BARRY traffic intelligence system. This allows supervisors and operators to log disruptions they have successfully resolved, providing accountability, performance tracking, and continuous improvement capabilities.

## What I've Created

### 1. **New Backend Service** ✅
**File**: `/backend/services/disruptionLogger.js`
- Complete service for logging, retrieving, and managing disruption records
- Tracks everything from incident details to resolution methods and performance metrics
- Includes statistics generation and health checking

### 2. **New API Endpoints** ✅ 
**Modified File**: `/backend/routes/api.js`
- Added 7 new API endpoints under `/api/disruptions/`
- Integrated with your existing API structure
- Full CRUD operations for disruption logs

### 3. **Database Schema** ✅
**New File**: `/backend/database/disruption_logs_schema.sql`
- Complete Supabase table structure
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Helpful views for reporting
- Stored procedures for maintenance

## API Endpoints Added

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/disruptions/log` | Log a new disruption achievement |
| `GET` | `/api/disruptions/logs` | Get disruption logs with filtering |
| `GET` | `/api/disruptions/statistics` | Get performance statistics |
| `PUT` | `/api/disruptions/logs/:logId` | Update an existing log |
| `GET` | `/api/disruptions/logs/:logId` | Get specific log by ID |
| `DELETE` | `/api/disruptions/logs/:logId` | Delete a log (admin only) |
| `GET` | `/api/disruptions/health` | Service health check |

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Database Setup**
You need to run the SQL schema in your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `/backend/database/disruption_logs_schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL script
5. This will create the `disruption_logs` table with all necessary indexes and policies

### 2. **Test the API**
After setting up the database, you can test the API:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/disruptions/health

# Log a disruption (example)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/disruptions/log \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "A1 Accident Cleared Successfully", 
    "type": "incident",
    "location": "A1 Northbound J65-J66",
    "supervisor_id": "SUP001",
    "supervisor_name": "John Smith",
    "depot": "Gateshead",
    "affected_routes": ["21", "X21", "25"],
    "resolution_method": "Traffic diverted via A167",
    "severity_level": "high",
    "resolution_time_minutes": 45
  }'

# Get logs
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/disruptions/logs?limit=10"

# Get statistics  
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/disruptions/statistics"
```

  "supervisor_name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "depot": "Sunderland",
  "affected_routes": ["16", "18", "20"],
  "resolution_method": "Recovery vehicle dispatched, lane cleared",
  "severity_level": "medium",
  "resolution_time_minutes": 25,
  "actions_taken": "Coordinated with Highways England, deployed recovery services",
  "customer_communications": ["Website update", "Social media alert"],
  "driver_notifications": "All Route 16/18/20 drivers notified via radio"
}
```

### 2. **Track Planned Roadworks Management**
```json
{
  "title": "Metro Centre Roadworks - Service Diversion",
  "type": "planned_works",
  "location": "Metro Centre East Car Park Access",
  "supervisor_id": "SUP456", 
  "affected_routes": ["100", "101"],
  "resolution_method": "Temporary bus stop relocated to West Car Park",
  "diversion_route": "Via Western Avenue instead of Eastern Avenue",
  "severity_level": "low",
  "preventable": false,
  "coordination_required": true,
  "external_agencies": ["Gateshead Council", "Metro Centre Management"]
}
```
