# üöÄ Go BARRY - cPanel Upload Guide

## Quick Upload Steps

### 1. Access cPanel File Manager
- Log into your cPanel account
- Open **File Manager**
- Navigate to `public_html` directory

### 2. Upload Files
- **Upload ALL files** from this deployment folder
- Make sure to upload:
  - `index.html` (main app file)
  - `static/` folder (contains CSS, JS, images)
  - `.htaccess` (routing and optimization)
  - `asset-manifest.json`
  - Any other files in this package

### 3. Set Permissions (if needed)
- Set folder permissions to `755`
- Set file permissions to `644`
- Set `.htaccess` permissions to `644`

### 4. Test Your Deployment

Visit these URLs after upload:

- **Main App**: https://gobarry.co.uk
- **Display Screen**: https://gobarry.co.uk/display  
- **Supervisor Interface**: https://gobarry.co.uk/browser-main

### 5. Verify Features

‚úÖ Check these work:
- Traffic alerts loading
- Map displaying (on production, not localhost)
- Supervisor login functionality
- Real-time updates
- Display screen rotation

### 6. Backend Connection

The frontend automatically connects to:
- **Backend API**: https://go-barry.onrender.com
- This provides all traffic data and functionality

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If alerts don't load:**
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify .htaccess was uploaded correctly
- Ensure backend API is running

**If routing doesn't work:**
- Verify .htaccess file was uploaded
- Check if mod_rewrite is enabled on your hosting

**Need help?** 
- Check browser developer console for errors
- Verify all files uploaded correctly
- Contact hosting support for .htaccess issues
