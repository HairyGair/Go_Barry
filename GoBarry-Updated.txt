üìã SUMMARY

Go BARRY has evolved from a concept to a fully operational traffic intelligence platform serving Go North East operations. With Phase 1 complete and Phase 2 60% implemented, the system provides real-time traffic monitoring, enhanced route analysis, and supervisor accountability tools across multiple interfaces.

The platform successfully processes data from multiple APIs, maintains 75%+ route matching accuracy, and provides sub-2-second response times while operating within cloud memory constraints. Recent improvements include mobile optimization, offline capabilities, and enhanced API reliability.

Current focus areas include machine learning integration, predictive analytics, and advanced supervisor tools to support Go North East's mission of providing reliable public transportation across the North East of England.
