- **Purpose:** Allow supervisors to view incident locations on map
- **Features:**
  - Opens Google Maps in new tab
  - Uses coordinates when available
  - Falls back to location search
  - Handles missing location data gracefully

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **File:** `test-enhanced-data-feeds.js`
- **Purpose:** Verify all new functionality works correctly
- **Tests:**
  - Time-based polling status
  - Duplicate detection statistics  
  - Enhanced geocoding accuracy
  - Map URL generation
  - Overall system integration

## Deployment

### API Endpoints Enhanced
- `/api/health-extended` - Now includes polling status and new service health
- `/api/alerts-enhanced` - Enhanced with duplicate detection and geocoding
- `/api/polling-status` - New endpoint for polling window status
- `/api/emergency-override` - Emergency override controls

### Configuration
- Respects all existing environment variables
- No additional configuration required
- Backward compatible with existing functionality
- Memory optimized for 2GB Render deployment

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Polling Window Compliance:** Check `/api/polling-status`
2. **Duplicate Detection Rate:** Monitor compression ratios
3. **Geocoding Success Rate:** Track geocoded incident percentages  
4. **API Call Limits:** Monitor daily usage per source
5. **Memory Usage:** Ensure stays under 2GB limit

### Expected Performance
- **Duplicate Reduction:** 10-30% fewer incidents displayed
- **Location Accuracy:** 80-90% of incidents with coordinates
- **API Compliance:** 100% adherence to free tier limits
- **Memory Usage:** <1.8GB peak usage
- **Response Time:** <2s including all enhancements

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Restore from backup: `.backup-20250614_080543`
2. Revert Git commit: `git revert HEAD`
3. Redeploy previous version
4. Emergency override: POST to `/api/emergency-override`

## Success Criteria

✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ Free tier limits respected (05:15-00:15)
✅ Duplicates removed across sources
✅ Incident geocoding improved
✅ Map functionality added for supervisors
✅ Memory usage optimized
✅ Comprehensive testing included
