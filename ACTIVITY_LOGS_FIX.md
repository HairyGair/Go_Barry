# Fix Instructions

## Issues Found:

1. **404 Error** - The activity log endpoints aren't being found
2. **SQL Policy Error** - The policies already exist (that's OK)

## To Fix:

### 1. Run this SQL to fix column lengths:
```sql
ALTER TABLE activity_logs 
ALTER COLUMN supervisor_id TYPE VARCHAR(20);

ALTER TABLE supervisor_sessions
ALTER COLUMN supervisor_id TYPE VARCHAR(20);

ALTER TABLE dismissed_alerts
ALTER COLUMN supervisor_id TYPE VARCHAR(20);
```

### 2. Restart your backend:
- The activity log routes should now be properly registered
- Check the console output for "üì¶ Registering activity logs routes..."

### 3. Test the endpoints:
```bash
chmod +x test-activity-endpoints.sh
./test-activity-endpoints.sh
```

### 4. Check backend logs:
The backend should now show the activity endpoints in its startup message:
- üìù Activity Logs: /api/activity-logs
- üìä Activity Summary: /api/activity-logs/summary  
- üíª Display View Log: /api/activity/display-view

## If Still Getting 404:

1. Make sure backend is fully restarted
2. Check that activityLogs.js is being imported correctly
3. Verify the routes are registered by checking backend startup logs

The routes are correctly defined - the issue is likely just that the backend needs to be restarted to pick up the changes.
