# Alert Deduplication Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Identified
- 7 duplicate incidents from Westerhope persisting for a week
- Alerts not properly expiring based on age
- Dismissed alerts reappearing after server restarts
- Weak deduplication only using location+type

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Advanced Alert Deduplication (`backend/utils/alertDeduplication.js`)
- **Smart hash generation** using location, title, description, and coordinates
- **Content-based consistency** - same incident gets same hash regardless of source
- **Source preference** - manual_incident > tomtom > here > national_highways > mapquest
- **Time-based selection** - newer alerts preferred over older ones

### 2. Automatic Age Management
- **4-hour expiry** for general alerts
- **2-hour expiry** for low severity alerts  
- **8-hour expiry** for high severity alerts
- **Automatic cleanup** of expired alerts during processing

### 3. Enhanced Dismissal System
- **Dual storage** - by alert ID and content hash
- **Persistent storage** - dismissals saved to `dismissed-alerts.json`
- **Restart recovery** - dismissals loaded on server startup
- **48-hour retention** - expired dismissals automatically cleaned up
- **Hash-based consistency** - dismissed alerts stay dismissed even with different IDs

### 4. Updated Alert Processing Pipeline
- **Enhanced filtering** using new deduplication system
- **Periodic cleanup** every 10 minutes for expired dismissals
- **Improved dismissal checking** with both ID and hash verification
- **Better logging** for debugging duplicate issues

## Files Modified
1. `backend/utils/alertDeduplication.js` - New advanced deduplication system
2. `backend/index.js` - Updated alert processing pipeline
3. Added automatic cleanup and persistence

## Expected Results
✅ **No more duplicate Westerhope incidents**
✅ **Alerts expire automatically after appropriate time**
✅ **Dismissed alerts stay dismissed across restarts**
✅ **Better deduplication accuracy**
✅ **Automatic cleanup of old dismissals**

## Monitoring
- Check logs for deduplication statistics
- Monitor dismissal persistence across restarts  
- Verify old alerts expire properly
- Watch for reduction in duplicate alerts

## Deployment
The fix has been deployed and should resolve the alert duplication issues immediately.
